# Assignment 9

## Task: Read and Plot Waveform (Binary)

This project involves reading seismic waveform data from a binary file, processing the data, and visualizing it using the PGPLOT library. The components of the project include Fortran programs for reading and plotting the waveform, converting time formats, writing data to text files, and a Python script for converting PostScript plots to PDF.

## Files

### 1. `PlotWaveform.f90`
This Fortran program reads a binary seismic data file (`seismicdata.bin`), extracts the header information, and plots the waveform data using PGPLOT.

**Key Features:**
- Reads the binary file with little-endian format.
- Extracts header information, including:
  - Code: Identification code (4 characters).
  - Origin Time: The origin time of the seismic event (double precision).
  - Number of Components (`ncom`): Typically 3 (East, North, Vertical).
  - Number of Data Points (`ndata`).
  - Sampling Interval (`dt`).
- Allocates memory for waveform data and reads the waveform data.
- Uses PGPLOT for visualization:
  - Plots the waveform for each component (E1, E2, E3).
  - Saves the plot as a PostScript file (`../plot/Code.ps`).

### 2. `ConvertOriginTime.f90`
This Fortran program converts the origin time from Julian Day format to a human-readable date format (YYYY-MM-DD).

**Key Features:**
- Accepts origin time as a floating-point value (Julian date).
- Converts it to standard date format (year, month, day).
- Handles leap years and different month lengths.

### 3. `WriteToFile.f90`
This Fortran subroutine writes seismic waveform data to a text file.

**Key Features:**
- Accepts a filename and seismic data structure as input.
- Writes the waveform data points to the specified file.
- Outputs a message indicating successful data writing.

### 4. `ps2pdf.py`
This Python script automates the conversion of PostScript (`.ps`) files generated by PGPLOT to PDF format using the `ps2pdf` command.

**Key Features:**
- Searches for `.ps` files in the `../plot/` directory.
- Converts each `.ps` file to a `.pdf` file using the `ps2pdf` utility.
- Outputs the conversion status for each file.

## How to Run

### Prerequisites
- **Fortran Compiler:** Ensure you have a Fortran compiler installed (e.g., `gfortran`).
- **PGPLOT Library:** The Fortran program relies on PGPLOT for plotting. Make sure the PGPLOT library is correctly installed and linked.
- **Python 3:** Required for running the `ps2pdf.py` script.
- **Ghostscript (`ps2pdf`):** Required for converting `.ps` files to `.pdf`.

### Compilation
To compile the Fortran programs, use the following commands:

```bash
gfortran -o PlotWaveform PlotWaveform.f90 -lpgplot
gfortran -o ConvertOriginTime ConvertOriginTime.f90
gfortran -c WriteToFile.f90
